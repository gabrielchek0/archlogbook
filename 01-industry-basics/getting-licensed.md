# Getting Licensed

A major milestone for budding architects would be getting licensed as an Registered Architect.

However, the journey towards getting licensed is long (2-5 years after Masters) but worth it, especially if you see yourself becoming an Architect in future.

Most countries require additional study, courses and exams after you graduate from your Bachelors. Some countries like Singapore require candidates to take Masters of Architecture course (1-2 more years) to be even eligible for the logging and exams.

## What do I need to prepare for licensure?

As a candidate for the exams, you would need to be familiar with:

* Building Contracts & Contract Administration
* Project Management & Stages
* Statutory and Contractual Duties
* Technical details
* Communication & Negotiation with Clients, Consultants and Authorities
* Building Codes & Compliance
* Feasibility Studies
* Types of Practices

(and so on…)

## **Process to becoming a licensed Architect in Singapore**

Below is information relevant for future architects in Singapore.

If you’re looking to get QP, here’s what you need to do:

* Read up on the requirements

[https://www.boa.gov.sg/register/requirements/](https://www.boa.gov.sg/register/requirements/)

* Download the application forms & guides

[https://www.boa.gov.sg/register/application-forms/](https://www.boa.gov.sg/register/application-forms/)

* Find a supervisor (your boss) and advisor (an Architect with 10 years of experience)
* Submit the forms at BOA office and purchase the logbook ($116+)
* Start logging your experience every month.
* You may prefer to handwrite your logbook or use the unofficial excel template [https://archi.sg/logsheet](https://archi.sg/logsheet)
* Every quarter, meet up with your supervisor and advisor to go through your logbook and also get the quarterly assessment report signed.
* Submit the quarterly assessment by post (note the deadlines)
* Once completed 24 months of logging, submit the application form along with your case study to sit for Professional Practice Examination (PPE)
* Study for the exams, gather cheat sheets and organise your resources
* Sit for the in-person written PPE examination (usually 1 whole day, 3hrs written paper x 2)
* Pass the exam
* Prepare for oral interview (usually 2-3months after paper)
* Sit for Oral Interview (1hr, panel of 4-5 Architects)
* Pass the Interview
* Wait for good news via post.
* Attend the BOA Presentation Ceremony.

### **Some Tips for PPE Candidates**

* Start the logging where you have opportunity to log most of your experiences in about 75% of the project stages.
* Plan strategically, start logging about August in order not to wait for a while to sit in the exam (usually March or May (COVID screwed up the schedule))
* You can choose to pause logging after a continuous logging of 12 months (required by BOA). You may want to do this if you’re really caught up with work or do not have much to write about.
* Write succinctly, summarise what issues you encounter and how you overcame them.
* Note the competencies requirement that BOA states in the guide for PPE candidates.
* Aim for breadth in the case study to showcase as many involvements in the various project stages.
* Aim for depth in the case study.
* For logging, show just 1-2 highlights.
* For case study, write in detail and showcase the technical and soft skills needed for an Architect
* Write in the shoes of a future Architect - how will you do things differently if you are a QP.
* Seek feedback from your Advisor/Supervisor early for case study.
* Do not leave the case study to the last minute.
* Start the case study 3 months before the deadline.
* Interview questions can be found in the SIA Young Architects League (SIA-YAL) Library
