According to ChatGPT, the following constitutes good building design:

* **Functionality:** A good building design should be well-suited to its intended purpose, with appropriate space allocation and efficient use of resources.
* **Efficiency:** It should be designed in a way that maximizes the use of space, natural light and other resources, in order to minimize energy consumption and costs.
* **Aesthetics:** A good building design should be visually pleasing and reflective of its location, context, and culture.
* **Sustainability:** It should be designed with the environment in mind, taking into account factors such as energy efficiency, use of natural light, and the use of sustainable materials.
* **Inclusivity:** A good building design should be accessible and inclusive for all users, regardless of their abilities. This includes features such as ramps, elevators, and wide doorways for wheelchair access.
* **Uniqueness:** A good building design should be unique, stands out and be reflective of its location, context, and culture. This can be achieved through the use of local materials, traditional building techniques, or a distinct architectural style.
* **Human-centered:** A good building design should be designed with people in mind. This means taking into account factors such as natural ventilation, acoustics, and access to natural light, as well as the psychological well-being of the users.

Good building design is subjective, and the above design considerations are not exhaustive, nor must all be met.

When researching projects, try to evaluate from various points of view and determine for yourself if the project is successful in achieving its design objectives.
