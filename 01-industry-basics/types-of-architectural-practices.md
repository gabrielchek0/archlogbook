There are various kinds of architecture practices, which can be broadly categorized based on scale and project types.

### Scale of practice:

* **Large firms:** These firms typically have a large number of employees and handle large-scale projects such as skyscrapers, airports, and large commercial developments.
* **Medium firms:** These firms typically have a moderate number of employees and handle a wide range of project types, including commercial, residential, and institutional projects.
* **Small firms:** These firms typically have a smaller number of employees and handle smaller-scale projects such as single-family homes, small commercial buildings, and renovations.

### Project types:

* **Residential architecture:** These practices specialize in designing homes, apartments, and other forms of residential buildings.
* **Commercial architecture:** These practices specialize in designing office buildings, retail centers, hotels, and other forms of commercial buildings.
* **Institutional architecture:** These practices specialize in designing schools, hospitals, government buildings, and other forms of institutional buildings.
* **Industrial architecture:** These practices specialize in designing factories, warehouses, and other forms of industrial buildings.
* **Landscape architecture:** These practices specialize in designing outdoor spaces such as parks, gardens, and other forms of open spaces.
* **Interior architecture:** These practices specialize in designing the interiors of buildings, including spaces such as offices, homes, and other forms of living or working spaces.

### Specializations:

* **Sustainability:** These practices specialize in designing buildings and spaces that are energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and promote healthy living.
* **Heritage:** These practices specialize in preserving, restoring, and adapting historical buildings and structures.
* **Urban design:** These practices specialize in designing and planning for entire neighborhoods, towns, and cities, including the design of public spaces and transportation systems.
* **Technology:** These practices specialize in designing buildings that incorporate the latest technology, such as smart buildings, and use of digital tools in design and construction.

It's worth noting that many architecture practices will have a combination of these characteristics, and the specific focus of a practice can evolve over time.
