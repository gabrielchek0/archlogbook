Social architecture is an approach to architecture that focuses on the social aspects of design and the role that architecture can play in shaping and improving communities.

Here are five key points summarizing what social architecture is:

1. **People-centered:** Social architecture places a strong emphasis on the needs and desires of the people who will use the space, rather than simply focusing on aesthetics or functionality.
2. **Community building:** Social architecture aims to promote social interaction and community building through the design of public spaces, shared spaces, and community facilities.
3. **Inclusion:** Social architecture strives to create inclusive spaces that are accessible to all members of the community, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.
4. **Empowerment:** Social architecture aims to empower communities by involving them in the design process and giving them a sense of ownership over their built environment. This is also called co-creation.
5. **Sustainability:** Social architecture often incorporates sustainable design principles, such as green spaces and energy-efficient building systems, to create healthy and livable communities.

## Why Is Social Architecture Important?

People should be at the heart of any architectural design project.

By understanding how people think, say and act, Architects can design for better, more holistic solutions in the buildings.

Ultimately, spaces should take into account the interconnectivity between people, place and activity, through Observation & Research, Mapping & Analysis, Co-creation & User input.

## The Key Aspects Of Social Architecture

We begin with the three aspects that makes social architecture - people, activity and place.

Studying each aspect and understanding the connections/ meaning across them will aid us architectural designers to create vibrant, sustainable social spaces for the community.

### People

What is social architecture without the people?

Here we are looking at the following when it comes to design research and goals:

* Communities
* Psychology
* Sociology
* Mindsets
* Identity

### Activity

Apart from people, we should also study events that occur which can also play a part in our design decisions in social architecture.

We are focusing on the following:

* Events (private vs public, individual vs group)
* Time of event
* Routines

### Place

Lastly, we should also study the importance of what makes a place 'the place', with key ideas such as:

* Typologies
* Climate data
* Icons (cultural, social)
* Landscape
* Objects

## How to get started

### Find Meaning And Connections

Architects should discover the interconnections between people, place and activity.

Research can be done through Observation & Research, Mapping & Analysis, Co-creation & User input.

By performing research, one will better understand the meaning of place and why people do certain activities with specific people.

### Ethnography & Research Methods

We can design for a more social architecture by proper research of people, activity and place.

Once there's a proper and tested hypothesis, we can proceed to design the architectural solution.

### Behavioral Mapping - AEIOU Method

The AEIOU Method is a methodology to perform a holistic analysis of a site.

AEIOU stands for:

Activity\
Environment\
Interactions\
Objects\
Users

### Fieldwork Techniques

These techniques includes Photographs, Recorded observation of users, Timelapses, Interviews

***

## Conclusion

To get started on social architecture, one can start by developing a empathy for the group of people you personally connect with. By fully understand users and occupants pains, journeys and stories, Architects can propose the most impactful design.\
\
Architects interested in social architecture should conduct interviews, gather data, seek quantitative data that justifies qualitative data to a hypothesis before starting to design.
