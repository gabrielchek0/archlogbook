# Social Architecture

Social architecture is an approach to architecture that focuses on the social aspects of design and the role that architecture can play in shaping and improving communities.

Here are five key points summarizing what social architecture is:

1. **People-centered:** Social architecture places a strong emphasis on the needs and desires of the people who will use the space, rather than simply focusing on aesthetics or functionality.
2. **Community building:** Social architecture aims to promote social interaction and community building through the design of public spaces, shared spaces, and community facilities.
3. **Inclusion:** Social architecture strives to create inclusive spaces that are accessible to all members of the community, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.
4. **Empowerment:** Social architecture aims to empower communities by involving them in the design process and giving them a sense of ownership over their built environment. This is also called co-creation.
5. **Sustainability:** Social architecture often incorporates sustainable design principles, such as green spaces and energy-efficient building systems, to create healthy and livable communities.
