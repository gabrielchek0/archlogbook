# Working with Project Briefs

Architects need to look out for the following in project brief from clients:

1. **Project scope and objectives**: Overall goals and objectives of the project, including the type and size of the building, the number of floors and rooms, and any specific features or amenities that are required.
2. **Site information**: Details about the location of the building, including the address, zoning regulations, and any environmental or historical considerations that may affect the design.
3. **Budget and timeline**: Established budget for the project and timeline for completion, including milestones for each phase of the project.
4. **Design requirements**: Specification of any design requirements or preferences that the client has, such as architectural style, materials, and color palette.
5. **Approval and permitting process:** Outline of the approval and permitting process that will be followed, including any relevant city or state codes and regulations.
6. **Consultants or contractors:** List the consultants or contractors that will be working on the project, including architects, engineers, and builders.
7. **Client's contact information**: Look out for the client's contact information, so that the architect can reach out with any questions or concerns throughout the project

List is non-exhaustive and can be added on if there is need to have more constraints and criteria of successful design and construction of the building.
