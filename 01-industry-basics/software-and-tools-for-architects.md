# Software & Tools for Architects

Architecture is increasingly digitalised. As a young and future architect, software skills are essential.

Software are available across all project stages, namely:

* Feasibility studies
* Schematic design
* Detailed design
* Render and visualizations
* 3D modelling
* Drafting and documentation

Here's a list of software that architects need to be familiar with:

1. **AutoCAD:** AutoCAD is one of the most widely used software applications for architects. It is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that allows architects to create accurate 2D drawings. AutoCAD offers a range of tools and features for designing and documenting architectural projects.
2. **Revit / ArchiCAD:** Revit and ArchiCAD are building information modeling (BIM) software that are specifically designed for architects and other building professionals. They allows architects to create intelligent 3D models of buildings, which can be used for design, analysis, and documentation purposes. These software also facilitates collaboration among different disciplines involved in a project.
3. **SketchUp:** SketchUp is a versatile 3D modeling software that is popular among architects for its intuitive interface and ease of use. It allows architects to create quick conceptual models, develop detailed designs, and generate presentations. SketchUp offers a vast library of pre-built 3D models and a supportive community that provides additional resources.
4. **Rhino:** Rhino, also known as Rhinoceros 3D, is a powerful 3D modeling software widely used in architecture. It supports both NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) and polygonal modeling techniques, making it suitable for creating complex and organic forms. Rhino offers a wide range of plugins and scripting capabilities, making it highly customizable. It is also the best software to get started on parametric design (learn more in the next post).
5. **Adobe Creative Suite:** While not specifically designed for architects, the Adobe Creative Suite (including software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign) is commonly used by architects for graphic design, rendering, and presentation purposes. Architects use Photoshop to enhance rendered images, Illustrator for creating vector graphics, and InDesign for layout and print preparation.
6. **Rendering software (Vray / Twinmotion / Lumion):** Last but not least we need software for visualisation of spaces that can be presented to clients. Vray and Twinmotion as great software to get started to render your 3D models into beautiful 2D graphics, they can even create flythroughs videos.

It's worth noting that there are many other software applications used by architects, and the choice of software may vary depending on personal preference, project requirements, and the specific tasks at hand.

Most of the time you will need to be familiar with all of the above software (one from each category).

If youâ€™re looking to learn software, I highly recommend YouTube or Linkedin Learning.
