To know how to thrive in the building industry as an Architect, let's try to understand what a supply chain of architecture practice is and and an Architect's role in it is.

## What is a Supply Chain?

A supply chain is the sequence of processes involved in the production and distribution of a commodity.

It consists of a network of entities and the bi-directional flow of materials, information and money.

## Bi-directional Flow of Materials, Money and Information

The supply of architecture can only work when there is three bi-directional flows along the supply chain, material, information, financial.

People pay money in exchange for information and material.

Without either flow, the supply chain will not work.

Knowing and understanding the various parties, products/services and flow will help us understand the opportunities for improving the efficiency of 'supplying' architecture.
