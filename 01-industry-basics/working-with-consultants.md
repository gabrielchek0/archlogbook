# Working with Consultants

An architect typically works with a variety of external consultants throughout the design and construction process of a building project. These consultants may include structural engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and other specialists who provide specialized expertise in areas such as acoustics, lighting, and fire protection.

The architect is also responsible for coordinating the work of these consultants, **ensuring that their designs are compatible** with the overall design concept and that they meet all necessary codes and regulations.

_(Note: Specialist design work needs to be checked by respective Qualified Person, who may or may not be the Architect. The Architect shall not be liable for any negligence on part of the Specialist.)_

Most importantly, the architect also acts as the primary point of contact between the consultants and the client, and is responsible for communicating the progress and any issues that arise during the project.
