# Design Process in Practice

The design process for architects typically includes the following steps:

1. **Initial consultation and project briefing:** This is where the architect meets with the client to discuss their needs, budget, and desired outcomes for the project.
2. **Site analysis and research:** The architect conducts a thorough analysis of the site, including its surroundings, zoning regulations, and potential environmental impacts.
3. **Concept development:** Based on the information gathered in the previous steps, the architect develops several conceptual design ideas for the project.
4. **Design development:** The architect refines and develops one of the conceptual design ideas into a more detailed design proposal.
5. **Technical design:** The architect develops detailed technical drawings and specifications for the building, including structural, electrical, and mechanical systems.
6. **Obtaining necessary approvals and permits:** The architect works with the client and any necessary authorities to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for the project.
7. **Construction documentation and administration:** The architect prepares detailed construction documents and oversees the construction process to ensure that the building is built according to the design and specifications.
8. **Post-construction evaluation:** The architect evaluates the completed building and makes any necessary adjustments to ensure that it meets the client's needs and functions as intended.

The process is non-exhaustive and may differ based on contract type and locale.
