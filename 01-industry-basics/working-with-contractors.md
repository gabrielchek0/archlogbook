The Architect shall collaborate with the Main Contractor to ensure successful execution of the building project.

There are 5 keys ways to do so:

1. **Drawings and specifications**: The architect provides detailed drawings and specifications for the construction.
2. **Site inspections:** The architect conducts site visits to monitor progress and address any issues that arise.
3. **Review request for approvals, information (RFA / RFI):** The architect reviews and approves submittals such as shop drawings and material samples. The contractor should also submit request for information if he needs more clarification or to raise discrepancies in the drawings.
4. **Coordination**: The architect coordinates the work of other consultants to ensure designs are integrated.
5. **Ensure proper construction as per drawing and specifications:** The architect works closely with the main contractor to ensure the design and plans are properly executed.
