Architects work with clients mainly by:

1. Understanding their needs and desires for a building project.
2. Using this information gathered to design a functional and aesthetic space that meets those requirements.
3. Providing guidance on materials, construction methods, and cost/time implications for certain design decisions.
4. Getting the necessary approvals and permits (planning permission, written permission, building plan approval, temporary occupation permit and statutory completion.
5. Overseeing the construction process and ensure that the finished product meets the client's expectations.
