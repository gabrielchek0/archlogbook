# Drafting / BIM conventions

BIM (Building Information Modeling) and drafting conventions play a significant role in the creation of construction drawings and specifications.

Here's how they are relevant to the architectural process:

### **BIM (Building Information Modeling):**&#x20;

BIM is a digital representation of a building or infrastructure project that encompasses both graphical and non-graphical information.&#x20;

BIM software allows architects to create intelligent 3D models that contain detailed information about the building's components, materials, systems, and performance attributes.&#x20;

BIM facilitates collaboration among different project stakeholders and improves the accuracy and efficiency of the design and construction process.&#x20;

When creating construction drawings and specifications using BIM, architects can extract relevant information from the model to generate detailed drawings, schedules, quantities, and specifications.

### **Drafting Conventions**

Drafting conventions are a set of standardized practices and guidelines followed by architects and drafters when creating construction drawings.&#x20;

These conventions ensure consistency, clarity, and readability of the drawings, enabling efficient communication between the design team and contractors.&#x20;

Common drafting conventions include the use of standardized symbols, line weights, line types, and graphic scales.&#x20;

By adhering to drafting conventions, architects ensure that their drawings can be easily understood and interpreted by all stakeholders involved in the construction process.

When incorporating BIM into the drafting process, architects can leverage the intelligent information stored within the BIM model to generate accurate and up-to-date construction drawings.&#x20;

BIM enables automatic coordination between different drawing views, reducing errors and conflicts. It also allows for the generation of 2D drawings directly from the 3D model, saving time and effort.

Ultimately, the combination of BIM and drafting conventions enhances the quality and efficiency of the design and construction documentation process, promoting effective collaboration and reducing potential errors or misunderstandings during the construction phase.

### Where to learn drafting and BIM in Singapore?

In Singapore, drafting conventions relate to **CP83 (Code of practice for construction computer-aided design (CAD) - CAD symbols) (**[**link**](https://www.singaporestandardseshop.sg/Product/SSPdtDetail/138e9eb3-8ecb-4e86-8fbb-482ee3a9cbce)**)** and there are various **BIM/VDC/IDD guides (**[**link**](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/buildsg/digitalisation/integrated-digital-delivery-idd/idd-resources)**)** as well as upcoming **IFC-SG for Corenet X (**[**link**](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/regulatory-info/building-control/corenet-x/resources/code-of-practice)**).**
