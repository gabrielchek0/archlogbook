# Hatches

Hatches are 2D patterns in architectural drawings such as plans and sections that represent the type of materials for any surface (wall, floor, roof etc).

These are important for effective communication of the correct building materials.

## Types of hatches

A few basic hatches all parties must recognise in architectural drawings include:

* Concrete
* Earth / ground
* Steel

By having a standardised set of hatch patterns for building materials, we have a common understanding on the building design. There will be less miscommunication amongst designers and less errors.

### Fun fact

Did you know Singapore has its own technical drafting standards, called CP83? It states out the industry standards for CAD drawings, including syntax for layers, linestyles and hatch patterns.
