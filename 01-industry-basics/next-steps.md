# Next Steps

You made it through the first chapter of the wiki! Congrats.

There is so much to learn about architecture practice in this wiki.

I suggest to take a break and consolidate your learnings before you proceed.

Remember, architecture is a lifelong journey. Fulfilling but tiring. So it is wise to rest and recharge before reading on!

PS: If you know of someone who may benefit from reading this wiki, share this with them.
