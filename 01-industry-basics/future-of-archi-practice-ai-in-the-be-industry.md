(This article was written purely with ChatGPT.)

**Prompt**: How can the future of architectural practice be like with artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to play a significant role in the future of architectural practice by assisting architects in various stages of the design process, from conceptualization to fabrication.

1. **Generating and Evaluating Design Options**: AI can be used to generate and evaluate design options, optimize building performance, and automate tedious tasks such as building code compliance checking.
2. **Utilizing big data to inform design:** AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data, such as building usage patterns, to inform the design of buildings that are more responsive to the needs of their users. AI will not replace Architects
