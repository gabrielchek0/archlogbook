# Additions & Alterations

## What is Addition and Alterations (A\&A)?

Addition and alterations in a building project refer to modifications made to an existing structure to accommodate new functions, improve functionality, or enhance its aesthetic appeal.

The **addition** aspect involves **expanding the existing building by constructing new spaces or appendages**, while **alterations** entail making **changes to the interior or exterior of the structure without necessarily increasing its size**.

These modifications can range from minor adjustments to major renovations, depending on the project's scope and goals.

## Notable examples of A\&As

**Case Study 1: The Louvre Pyramid, Paris** One notable example of architectural alterations is the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei. The Louvre Museum sought to address the need for increased exhibition space and improved visitor flow within its historic building. Pei's design involved adding a striking glass and metal pyramid structure in the central courtyard of the museum. This addition not only provided additional exhibition areas but also created a grand entrance, enhancing the museum's accessibility and visual impact.

**Case Study 2: Tate Modern, London** The transformation of the Bankside Power Station into the Tate Modern art gallery is another prominent example of architectural alterations. Designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, the project involved converting the former industrial building into a contemporary art museum. The architects preserved the iconic exterior brickwork while making substantial alterations to the interior to create a series of exhibition spaces. The adaptive reuse of the power station not only preserved its architectural heritage but also provided a unique setting that resonates with the museum's modern and contemporary art collection.

In both of these case studies, the addition and alterations to the existing structures were pivotal in reimagining the spaces and achieving the desired functionality while respecting their historical significance. These projects showcase the potential for architectural interventions to breathe new life into existing buildings and transform them into iconic landmarks.
