# Design & Coordination Basics

Often times, you will need to work with the project engineers across disciplines on a wide variety of design and coordination issues.

Below is an overview of the many design considerations that require both architects and engineers to work out together:

## Architecture & Structure

Checking for consistency with design of structural elements and external works in relation to architectural design requirements

Aspects:

* Structural elements - Types of walls, parapet/kerbs, floor, columns, roofs, beams, railings
* Dimensions - Headroom, clear width & height, thickness, setting out, storey height, beam depth & column sizes
* Openings - for doors, windows
* External works - driveways, drainage, detention tank, entrance culvert, slopes, retaining walls, levels.

## Architecture & Mechanical

Checking for consistency with design of fire safety provision, sanitary/sewerage, gas/water as well as ventilation provision in relation to architectural design requirements.

Aspects:

* Ventilation - Types of Mechanical Ventilation, Ducting layout, Air conditioning
* Sanitary/Sewerage Layout
* Water - Domestic tank and supply
* Fire protection - Sprinkler provision, smoke purging/extraction, hosereel, hydrant, fire pumps
* Gas - pipe layout, incoming location

## Architecture & Electrical

Checking for consistency with design of equipment location, lighting provision and lighting protection among other building services in relation to architectural design requirements.

Aspects:

* Electricity - Substation Design, Lead in, Drawpit
* Lighting - Fitting type, illuminance, temperature, lux, positions based on false ceiling layout
* Fire safety - Exit Light/Sign, emergency lighting, voice comms, fire alarm panels
* Cable/switch types, location & layout - eg. office layout
* Fibre optics - Internet
* Telephone line
* Security systems - CCTV
* Lightning Protection System

The list above is non exhaustive.

Architects need to collaborate and prepare the necessary information for effective design:

* Site plans with site boundary, buffers, driveway and building layout
* Fire plans - locations of hydrants, fire rated walls/compartments
* Combined services design layout (CSD) - Underground, high level at all storeys, roof plans
* Plans, sections, elevations of buildings
* Typical details
* Survey plans - with all existing site information (public drains, infrastructure)
* Any other relevant design and compliance requirements

With tight design collaboration and coordination upstream during a building project, there will lesser issues during construction ðŸš§.

So do not ignore your engineer and blindly assume the design can be built!
