# Elevations

_When preparing architectural elevation drawings, architects should consider several key aspects to ensure accuracy and clarity:_

### **Scale and Proportion**

To maintain consistent scale and proportion across the elevation drawing to accurately represent the building's dimensions. This ensures that the drawing is a reliable representation of the intended design.

### **Levels and Heights**

To clearly depict different levels and heights in the elevation drawing through level datum lines for all stories. This helps viewers understand the vertical dimension of the building and how different elements align vertically.

### **Detailing**

To include sufficient details to convey the design intent clearly. Pay attention to features such as size of doors, windows, facades, and architectural elements. Clearly depict materials and textures to communicate the aesthetic aspects of the design using text or hatch annotations.
