## What is a level?

A level indicates how high an element is placed based from a universal height datum/reference.

It is represented by a numeric value which specifies the height above sea level.

Floor levels are to be indicated on all floor plans & sections for a few reasons:

* To indicate vertical locations of floor slabs, roofs, canopies, and any horizontal surfaces.
* Statutory requirements like platform level to better understand how the building is integrated with the existing terrain/context

## Types of Levels

Structural Slab Level - Underside of the slab&#x20;

Structural Floor Level - Top level of the slab before architectural finishes&#x20;

Finished Floor Level - Top level above architectural finishes

### Fun fact - Did you know Singapore's mimimum platform level is 104m/105m above sea level?

This is set by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) Code of Practice (Drainage). It is to safeguard our buildings from flood risk.

## Common levels to be established:

From bottom to top:

* Level outside the development
* Driveway Level
* Apron Level
* First Storey Level (Minimum Platform Level)
* Upper Storey Levels
* Roof Level (top of roof slab or bottom of roof eaves for sloped roofs)

## Pro Tip: Establish levels early

It is important to establish working levels early to prevent any miscommunication and errors in the construction of the building elements. Architects are in charge of establishing the levels mentioned above as all the engineers will refer to the same levels for their designs.

Should there be any changes, architects must inform all parties to follow suit.
