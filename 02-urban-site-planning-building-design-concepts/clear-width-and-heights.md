# Clear Width & Heights



Establishing clear widths and heights stands out as a fundamental task that architects and designers must undertake with utmost care.&#x20;

In this article, we will explore the importance of setting clear widths and heights in architectural design to ensure safety for occupants, avoid non-compliance and abortive work to rectify them.

## **Defining Clear Widths and Heights**

Before delving into the reasons behind the significance of clear widths and heights, let's clarify what these terms mean in the realm of architectural design:

* **Clear Width:** Clear width refers to the unobstructed, open space between two fixed points, typically measured horizontally. This measurement is crucial for various reasons, such as ensuring accessibility, defining circulation paths, and complying with safety regulations.
* **Clear Height:** Clear height pertains to the vertical measurement of unobstructed space between the floor and ceiling or between two fixed points. Clear height considerations are vital for ensuring proper headroom of minimum 2 metres and creating functional spaces that adhering to design and  standards.

## **Accommodating Additional Space for Finishes & Services**

One of the key aspects of establishing clear widths and heights that often goes overlooked is the need to accommodate additional space for finishes.&#x20;

Finishes encompass a wide range of materials and elements, including wall coverings, baseboards, trim, and more.&#x20;

Services encompass light fittings, fire protection systems, ventilation ducts and more that usually run overhead.

Setting aside extra space for finishes & services serve as a prudent design strategy for several reasons:

### **1. Accessibility Compliance**

Accessibility is a crucial consideration in modern architectural design. Clear widths must adhere to accessibility standards to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges, such as those using wheelchairs or walkers. By incorporating extra space for finishes, designers can ensure that the clear width remains compliant even after the installation of finishes.

### **2. Fire Safety Requirements**

Clear widths also play a pivotal role in fire safety. In the event of an emergency evacuation, unobstructed and sufficiently wide corridors are essential for safe passage. Designing with extra space for finishes can help maintain the required clear width even when considering potential protrusions like wall-mounted fire extinguishers or handrails.

### **3. Workmanship Considerations**

In any construction project, achieving absolute precision in workmanship can be a challenge. Small variations or imperfections can occur during installation. By allocating extra space for finishes, architects and designers provide a buffer that can absorb these imperfections, ensuring that the final result meets the intended design standards.

For example, when planning the clear width of a corridor, adding an extra 50mm (or more) for finishes along the walls can compensate for any discrepancies in the alignment of baseboards or wall coverings (eg. plastering). This attention to detail enhances the overall visual quality of the space.

## **Practical Applications**

### **Clear Width**

Let's consider a practical example to illustrate the importance of accommodating additional space for finishes. Imagine designing a hotel corridor with a clear width requirement of 1,200mm to comply with accessibility guidelines and fire safety regulations. By planning for an extra 50mm on each side for finishes, the total clear width would be 1,300mm.

In this scenario, even if the installation of wall coverings or baseboards results in slight misalignments, the corridor's clear width remains comfortably above the minimum requirement of 1,200mm. This not only ensures compliance with regulations but also enhances the corridor's appearance and functionality.

### Clear Height

Consider a modern office building where architects, in pursuit of creating a sleek and minimalist interior, design a lobby with a stunningly low ceiling.&#x20;

However, they fail to account for the necessary overhead services like lighting fixtures, air conditioning vents, and fire sprinkler systems. As a result, these services end up infringing on the already limited headroom of min 2.0m, not only compromising the aesthetic vision but also creating an uncomfortable and cluttered space for occupants.&#x20;

This oversight highlights the importance of meticulously planning clear heights to ensure that both functionality and design intent are seamlessly integrated into the final architectural vision.

## **Conclusion**

In the intricate world of architectural design, every detail matters. Establishing clear widths and heights is a foundational step that architects and designers must undertake with precision and foresight.&#x20;

By accounting for additional space for finishes and overhead services, especially in the context of structural elements like columns and structural floor to floor height, design professionals can address workmanship issues, maintain accessibility compliance, ensure fire safety for safe occupancy in future.&#x20;
