# Designing for Fire Safety

Fire safety is a fundamental aspect of architectural design, ensuring the protection of occupants, property, and emergency responders in the event of a fire.&#x20;

Here’s an overview of fire safety principles for both **building scale** and **site layout**, with key considerations for each.

***

### **1. Purpose Group**

**Fire safety requirements will depend on the Purpose Group (PG), which is the main function of the building.**

For example, Singapore classifies the buildngs into various Purpose Group starting from least hazardous to most. The more hazardous the PG is, the more strict requirements are.

PG 1 - Small residential (Residential dwelling house, such as: bungalow, detached house, semi-detached house & terrace house)

PG 2 - Other residential (Accommodation for residential purposes other than any premises comprised in PG I, such as: apartment, cluster housing, condominium flat, maisonette, town house)

PG 3 - Institutional (Education/Training facilities, Worker lodging, Healthcare)

PG 4 - Offices

PG 5 - Shops

PG 6 - Factory

PG 7 - Place of Public Resort (Communal facilities, Hotels, Museums, Auditoriums, Stadiums, Transport Facilities)

PG 8 - Warehouse (storage of goods/vehicles eg: Carpark, Coldroom)

### **2. Building Scale**

**Compartmentation**&#x20;

* Compartmentation is the limitation of extents of a space that is protected by fire rated elements (walls, slab) by height and/or cubic volume.
* Also used to separate spaces of different purpose groups.
* Fire rated walls and doors are used to 'compartment' these spaces to prevent fire spread.
* Fire rating will depend on purpose of the space. The more hazardous the use, the higher fire rating required. &#x20;
* If compartmentation is not feasible, the provision of sprinkler is required.

**Means of Escape vs. Occupant Load Calculations**

* **Occupant Load**: Determine the maximum number of occupants for each space based on its use and size.
* **Means of Escape**: Ensure exits are adequate to accommodate the calculated occupant load, factoring in capacity and evacuation time.

**Travel Distance to Nearest Exit**

* Limit the maximum travel distance to the nearest exit to ensure swift evacuation.
* Check your local fire code for the applicable max travel distance (1-way and 2-way, depending on program)

**Exit Provisions**

* **Number of Exits**: Provide at least two exits for rooms and spaces exceeding the occupant load threshold.
* **Clear Width of Exits**: Maintain clear widths (e.g., **900mm for single exits**, more for larger loads).
* **Separation of Exits**: Ensure exits are well-separated to prevent a single fire from obstructing all routes.
* **Protected Corridors/Staircases**: Design fire-rated, smoke-free paths leading directly to external spaces.
* **Exit signs and exit directional signs:** To direct occupants towards nearest exit.

**Firemen Access**

* **Facade Openings**: Incorporate accessible openings for fire brigade operations.
* **Breeching Inlet**: Provide inlets at strategic locations to allow firefighters to connect water supplies.&#x20;
* **Fire Lifts**: Include fire-rated lifts with independent power and fireproof shafts for firefighter use.
* **Hosereels**: Position hosereels for coverage of all spaces within 30 meters.

**Building Materials and Fire Safety Products**

* Use fire-rated materials for walls, floors, and structural elements, ensuring compliance with required fire-resistance durations (e.g., **1–4 hours**).
* Install certified fire doors, fire stops, and smoke seals in critical areas.

**Fire Protection Systems**

* **Sprinkler Systems**: Automatically suppress fires in sprinklered buildings.
* **Detectors and Alarms**: Install smoke and heat detectors to alert occupants promptly.
* **Manual Call Points**: Place at exits and in prominent locations for manual alarm activation.
* **Emergency Voice Communication Systems and alarm monitoring**: For real-time monitoring and communication with fire post during emergencies.

### **3. Site Layout**

**Fire Engine Accessway Provision**

* **Length and Perimeter**: Ensure  accessibility for fire engines, with a minimum clearance width of **4.0 meters for access road**. **6.0 meters for fire engine accessway.**
* **Turning Radius**: Design accessways with turning radii suitable for fire engines.

**Hydrant and Breeching Inlet Locations**

* **Hydrant Placement**: Position fire hydrants within **50 meters** of a breeching inlet or building entry points.
* **Breeching Inlets**: Locate inlets near main accessways for easy connection by the firefighters.

***

### **Integration and Compliance**

* Follow local fire codes and regulations to ensure designs meet the fire safety requirements
* Typically, the more hazardous the building program, the more strict the requirements are.
* Fire safety plans are to be submitted and approved before construction.
* There are 2 kinds of compliance: Prescriptive and Performance Based.
  * Prescriptive: Where the design is following the applicable Fire Code.
  * Performance-based: Where the design cannot comply to Fire Code and requires additional fire engineering assessment. Do engage early with fire safety engineers and authorities to review plans for compliance.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fire safety design requires a comprehensive approach that considers both the building's internal layout and its integration with the surrounding site.&#x20;

By addressing means of escape, fire protection systems, and access provisions for emergency responders, architects can create environments that prioritize occupant safety while meeting regulatory requirements.&#x20;

Balancing functionality and safety is key to effective fire safety planning.
