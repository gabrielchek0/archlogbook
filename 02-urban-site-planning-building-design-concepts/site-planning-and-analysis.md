# Site Planning & Analysis

Here's a short summary on how an architect should approach site analysis and site layout planning:

### **1) Understand the Context**

Begin by comprehending the site's physical, historical, cultural, and environmental context. This includes factors like climate, topography, neighboring structures, underground services, nearby infrastructure (roads, footpaths, bus stops) and local regulations (setbacks and buffers). Take photos for easy reference.

### **2) Obtain Existing Topographical / Survey Plan**

Appoint a registered surveyor to come up with the topographical survey plan to document existing features, such as roads, trees, soil conditions, utilities, neighbouring buildings and any restrictions that may affect the design. This plan should be in CAD and adjusted to SVY21 format for accurate siting of your buildings and ease of coordination. Do check for the site boundary line and ensure all coordinates (northings and eastings) are indicated in the survey plan.

### **3) Test Out Massing and Layout**&#x20;

Familiarize yourself with local planning laws and building codes. Ensure that your design complies with these regulations.

Plan the site's layout- start to position your buildings and driveways, considering factors like circulation, parking, landscaping, and outdoor spaces. Prioritize efficiency and accessibility. Orientate building fenestrations away from west to reduce solar heat gain in your buildings.&#x20;

### **4) Accessibility**

Prioritize accessibility by considering access points, clear wayfinding/pathways for all users (vehicles and pedestrians). Do consider connectivity to various transport nodes such as bus stops, cycling paths and train stations. Also consider public and private access points.

### **5) Aesthetics and Visual Appeal**

Pay attention to aesthetics and visual harmony. Create a coherent design that complements the surroundings and enhances the site's beauty. Have a dialogue with the urban context.

### Different site, different approach.

Remember that every site is unique, and the approach to site analysis and layout planning should be tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of each project.&#x20;

By following these best practices, architects can create innovative, functional, and sustainable spaces that enrich the built environment.
