## What does an Architect do for feasibility studies?

An architectural feasibility study is a process that architects use to determine whether a project is feasible before proceeding with the design and construction phases.

**Here are some of the steps that an architect may take when performing a feasibility study:**

* Zoning code research: This is where the architect asks preliminary questions such as whether the client's desired use and/or improvement is allowed on the proposed site.
* Site feasibility, opportunities, and constraints: The architect conducts a cursory review for site opportunities and constraints on the purchase site and surrounding properties.
* Program development: The architect develops a program that outlines the client's needs and requirements for the project.
* In-house real estate broker: The architect may consult with an in-house real estate broker to determine whether there is a market for the proposed project.
* Cost analysis: The architect performs a cost analysis to determine whether the project is financially feasible.

## What's the difference between a feasibility study and site analysis?

A site analysis is an evaluation of the physical and environmental characteristics of a site, while a feasibility study is an analysis of the economic and technical viability of a project.

In other words, a site analysis looks at the physical characteristics of a site, such as its topography, soil conditions, and vegetation, while a feasibility study looks at whether a project is financially and technically feasible.
