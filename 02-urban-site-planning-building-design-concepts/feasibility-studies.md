# Feasibility Studies

An architectural feasibility study is a method used by architects to assess the viability of a project before moving forward with its design and construction.&#x20;

Here are some steps an architect might undertake during a feasibility study:

1. **Research on zoning codes:** The architect initially investigates if the client's desired use and/or improvement is permissible on the intended site.
2. **Assessment of site feasibility, opportunities, and limitations:** The architect conducts a preliminary review of the potential and challenges of the site being considered for purchase, as well as the neighboring properties.
3. **Development of a project program:** The architect creates a program detailing the client's needs and specifications for the project.
4. **Consulting with an in-house real estate broker:** The architect may seek advice from an in-house real estate broker to evaluate the market potential for the proposed project.
5. **Cost analysis:** The architect carries out a cost analysis to ascertain the financial viability of the project.

### What is the difference between a feasibility study and site analysis?

As for the distinction between a feasibility study and site analysis, a site analysis is the examination of a site's physical and environmental attributes, while a feasibility study evaluates the economic and technical practicality of a project.&#x20;

In essence, a site analysis focuses on a site's physical aspects like topography, soil conditions, and vegetation.&#x20;

In contrast, a feasibility study determines the financial and technical feasibility of a project.
