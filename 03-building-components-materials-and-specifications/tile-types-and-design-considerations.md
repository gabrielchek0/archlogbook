# Tile Types and Design Considerations

Tiles are one of the most commonly used architectural finishes, known for their durability, versatility, and aesthetic appeal.&#x20;

Whether used for floors, walls, bathrooms, or thresholds, proper selection and detailing are critical to ensuring long-term performance and visual consistency.&#x20;

This article outlines the different types of tiles, materials, key design considerations, and common on-site mistakes to avoid.

***

### **1. Classification of Tiles by Use**

| Application Area              | Typical Tile Type                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internal Floors**           | Homogeneous, ceramic, porcelain, timber-look tiles  |
| **External Floors**           | Porcelain (R11+), granite, anti-slip textured tiles |
| **Bathroom Floors**           | Slip-resistant ceramic or porcelain (R10–R11)       |
| **Wall Tiles (Accent Tiles)** | Glazed ceramic, porcelain, decorative tiles         |
| **Threshold Tiles**           | Wide transition tiles at door/entrances             |
| **Nosing Tiles**              | Nosing tiles with anti-slip finish (50mm - 75mm)    |

### **2. Tile Materials**

* **Porcelain Tiles**: Dense, low water absorption, ideal for high-traffic areas.
* **Ceramic Tiles**: More porous than porcelain, suitable for light-use areas.
* **Homogeneous Tiles**: Uniform colour throughout; scratch and wear-resistant.
* **Timber-look Tiles**: Porcelain or ceramic with woodgrain design.
* **Stone-look Tiles**: Mimic granite or marble with textured finishes.
* **Granite Tiles**: Natural stone, highly durable but more expensive.

### **3. Slip Resistance Ratings (Singapore Standards)**

Slip resistance is critical, especially in wet or outdoor areas. In Singapore, slip resistance is generally specified using **DIN 51130 ramp test ratings**:

| Rating  | Application                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **R9**  | Dry indoor areas only                         |
| **R10** | Bathrooms, kitchens, semi-wet zones           |
| **R11** | Outdoor areas, wet rooms, commercial kitchens |

> Refer to BCA's "Good Industry Practices – Flooring" and SS 485:2011 (Singapore Standard for Slip Resistance Classification).

### **4. Typical Tile Sizes**

| Size (mm)                           | Common Usage                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 300 x 300                           | Bathrooms, feature walls                        |
| 300 x 600                           | Residential floors and walls                    |
| 600 x 600                           | Living and dining floors                        |
| 900 x 150                           | Timber-look tile planks                         |
| Large Format (1200 x 600 or larger) | Commercial or high-end residential floors/walls |

### **5. Types of Tile Joints**

* **Straight Joints**: Aligned grout lines, clean and modern look
* **Staggered Joints**: Used with timber-look tiles for natural appearance
* **Mitre Joints**: Used at corners to eliminate visible edge trims

***

### **6. Best Practices in Tile Installation**

* Avoid small cut tiles (<50mm) at edges and thresholds
* Minimise **lippage** (height difference between adjacent tiles)
* Align floor and wall tiles, especially in bathrooms
* Choose tile size that fits the room with minimal cutting
* **Size rooms in increments of 50mm** for easier tile setting out

***

### **7. Tips for Tile Setting Out**

* Start tile layout from the entrance and work inwards
* Align tiles with major features: **windows, doors, cabinetry**
* Avoid narrow tile strips at room entrances
* Maintain alignment across rooms and wall junctions
* Dry lay tiles to check pattern and symmetry before installation

***

### **8. Communicating Tiled Finishes to Contractors**

Architects typically communicate tile finishes through the following documents:

* **Architectural Specifications**: Describe tile material, size, slip resistance rating, joint types, adhesives, and grout colour.
* **Finishes Schedule / Finishes Plan**: Annotated floor plans showing location, type, and code of finishes in each space (e.g. T01: 600x600 homogeneous tile, R10).
* **Tile Setting Out Plans**: Detailed drawings indicating layout grids, alignment points, joint lines, and coordination with fixtures and openings. These help avoid cut tiles at doors and ensure continuity across rooms.
* **Section Details**: Include thresholds, skirting junctions, transitions to other finishes (e.g. carpet or vinyl), and waterproofing build-up in wet areas.

> Tip: Always coordinate tile setting out with floor traps, doorways, and window frames early in the design stage to reduce site improvisation and rework.

### **9. Common Errors to Avoid**

| Mistake                          | Result                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Using wrong slip-resistance tile | Safety hazards in wet areas          |
| Misaligned tiles                 | Poor visual outcome, rework needed   |
| Small cut tiles at entrances     | Unprofessional finish                |
| Poor setting out                 | Visible tiling errors, poor symmetry |
| Grout colour mismatch            | Distracts from tile pattern          |

***

### **Conclusion**

Tiles, while common, require thoughtful design and precise execution. Choosing the right material, slip rating, size, and layout approach will go a long way in delivering a high-quality finish that is both functional and visually consistent. Proper setting out, coordination with architectural elements, and knowledge of best practices will significantly improve workmanship and performance.
