# Types of Walls and Wall Systems: A Practical Guide for Architects

Walls are fundamental elements of a building that serve both structural and spatial functions. Choosing the right type of wall is not just about structural requirements—it also involves considerations of constructability, acoustic and fire performance, cost, sustainability, and compliance with regulatory frameworks like BCA's Buildability Framework and Green Mark in Singapore.

This guide breaks down the different types of walls, their characteristics, and key considerations for architects to make informed decisions during design and documentation.

## **1. Classification of Wall Types**

### **1.1 Load-Bearing Walls**

These walls support the weight of structural elements above, such as slabs, beams, and roofs.

* **Examples**: Reinforced concrete walls, AAC load-bearing walls, brick masonry walls (low-rise)
* **Use Case**: Core walls, external structural walls, party walls in landed houses

### **1.2 Non-Load-Bearing Walls**

These walls serve only as partitions or enclosures.

* **Examples**: Drywalls (gypsum), lightweight block walls, partition walls
* **Use Case**: Internal partitioning, room subdivisions, corridor enclosures

## **2. Key Design Considerations for Selecting Wall Types**

| Consideration             | Impact on Selection                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Labour Intensity**      | Wet trades (e.g., RC walls, brick walls) are labour-intensive. Drywall systems reduce manpower.                                        |
| **Sustainability**        | Use Green Mark certified systems and recyclable materials like drywall and AAC blocks.                                                 |
| **Cost**                  | Includes material, installation, and finishing costs. Lightweight systems may reduce structural load and cost.                         |
| **Acoustic Performance**  | Critical for party walls, residential units, and offices. Drywall with insulation can perform well.                                    |
| **Fire Rating**           | Certain spaces (e.g., riser shafts, escape corridors) require FRL-compliant walls.                                                     |
| **Wall Thickness**        | Impacts usable floor area. Drywalls offer thinner profiles than block or RC walls.                                                     |
| **Finish Compatibility**  | Heavier finishes (tiles, stone cladding) require walls with sufficient load-bearing capacity.                                          |
| **Buildable Score**       | Lightweight and prefabricated wall systems score higher under BCA’s buildability framework for Labour Saving Index (LSI)               |
| **Green Mark Compliance** | Materials with low embodied carbon and good lifecycle ratings contribute positively. SGBC labelled products are best for this purpose. |

## **3. Common Wall Systems – Summary Table**

| Wall System                                      | Load Bearing       | Advantages                                                                                           | Disadvantages                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Drywall (Gypsum Board)**                       | No                 | Lightweight, fast installation, good acoustic rating (with insulation), Green Mark certified options | Limited impact resistance, not suitable for wet areas without treatment |
| **Lightweight Precast Concrete Panel**           | Yes/No             | Prefabricated, high buildable score, consistent quality                                              | Crane required, heavy, transportation and coordination needed           |
| **Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) Block Wall** | Depends on density | Lightweight, fire resistant, good thermal insulation, easy to cut                                    | Brittle, not ideal for anchoring heavy items without support            |
| **Precision Block Wall (e.g., hollow blocks)**   | No                 | Good dimensional accuracy, less finishing required                                                   | Labour intensive, moderate acoustic performance                         |
| **RC Wall (cast-in-situ)**                       | Yes                | High structural integrity, excellent fire rating                                                     | Time-consuming, wet trade, low buildability score                       |
| **Brick Wall (Clay or Cement Bricks)**           | Depends on density | Traditional aesthetics, high durability                                                              | Very labour intensive, low speed of construction                        |

### **4. Actionable Tips for Architects**

* **Match wall type with function**: Use drywall or AAC for internal partitions; RC or precast concrete for structural cores or wet areas.
* **Factor in wall thickness early**: Coordinate wall types with M\&E and space planning to avoid clashes and lost space.
* **Think buildability from Day 1**: Propose wall systems that improve BCA Buildable Design Score. Use precast wall systems for higher LSI and Buildable Score.
* **Align with Green Mark**: Select certified wall systems and finishes with environmental declarations (SGBC products)
* **Plan finishes accordingly**: Tiled or heavy cladded walls require stronger substrates—coordinate wall types with finishes.
* **Acoustic Ratings -** Refer to product specifications for acoustic ratings eg. STC
* **Fire Requirements**: Refer to SCDF codes for wall ratings required in different building types (e.g. 1-hour fire rating for risers).

### **Conclusion**

Understanding wall systems goes beyond technical specs—it impacts cost, speed, compliance, and user comfort. Architects play a key role in proposing practical, code-compliant wall types that enhance constructability while aligning with sustainability goals. Always balance performance with practicality, and communicate clearly through specifications, wall type legends, and detailed drawings.
