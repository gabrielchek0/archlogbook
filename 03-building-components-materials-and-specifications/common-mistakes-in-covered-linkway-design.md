# Common Mistakes in Covered Linkway Design

Covered linkways are a staple in public and residential developments across Singapore, providing sheltered connections between buildings, transport nodes, and communal amenities.&#x20;

While they may seem like straightforward structures, poor detailing or coordination can lead to major functional and maintenance issues down the line.&#x20;

Based on common pain points observed in practice, here are seven key mistakes to avoid when designing covered linkways — especially those with free-fall roofs discharging to house drains.

***

### 1. **Overcomplicating Roof Geometry with Curved Structures**

While curved linkway roofs may appear more elegant, they introduce complexity at intersections. When connecting to other perpendicular roofs, a seamless connection is hard to achieve without:

* Having a separate roof at the connection, or
* Raising the height of one roof to allow rainwater to fall cleanly onto another (i.e., free-fall principle).

**Good Practice:**\
Use simple pitched roofs for easier interfacing. This allows for clearer rain discharge routes and simplifies structural and flashing details.

***

### 2. **Following Ramp Gradients Without Proper Roof Discharge**

It may seem logical to follow the slope of an accessibility ramp with the linkway roof, but without a proper rain discharge strategy, water can stagnate.

**Why It’s a Problem:**

* No gutters are allowed (due to mosquito breeding risk per NEA regulations).
* Sloped roofs without fixed discharge levels may direct water back toward pedestrian walkways.

**Good Practice:**\
Maintain a _fixed roof level_ independent of ramp gradients. Let rainwater discharge via eaves away from the walkway, with downflow directed to adjacent drains.

***

### 3. **Inadequate Sections — Especially at Building Interfaces**

Failing to draw enough sections, particularly where the linkway connects to a building, often results in unclear flashing details.

**Result:**\
Contractors may improvise or dispute missing information, leading to water ingress or compliance issues.

**Good Practice:**\
Cut detailed cross and longitudinal sections showing roof-to-wall connections, flashing, and junction details clearly.

***

### 4. **Misaligned Roof Eaves and House Drains**

When the eave of the linkway roof doesn’t line up with the house drain, rainwater splashes onto walkways instead of being captured effectively.

**Good Practice:**\
Align the drip edge of the roof directly over the house drain, ensuring water falls cleanly into it.

***

### 5. **Inadequate Coverage from Rain**

A frequent complaint is that rain still gets into covered walkways due to poor sizing or misalignment of the roof.

**Good Practice:**\
Design for lateral rain (driven by wind) by ensuring:

* Sufficient overhang (usually 600–1000mm)
* Roof width accommodates wind-blown rain from all directions
* Consider sun path and prevailing wind directions in your orientation

***

### 6. **Incorrect Column Positioning**

Columns that are too close to the edge of the roof may lead to constructability issues or affect flow of rainwater.

**Good Practice:**\
Set columns _at least 300–600mm inboard_ from the roof eaves to allow for proper overhang, maintenance access, and visual clarity.

***

### 7. **Roof Eaves Too Close to Driveways**

If the eaves of a low linkway roof overhang too close to driveways, they are at risk of vehicular damage (e.g., by tall vans or service vehicles).

**Good Practice:**\
Maintain _a minimum 600mm setback_ between the eave and any vehicular path. Coordinate with traffic movement paths and height clearances.

***

### Final Thoughts

Designing covered linkways requires an appreciation of function, maintenance, and alignment with urban infrastructure. Many of these mistakes stem from insufficient coordination between architectural, civil, and structural inputs — so early-stage cross-discipline reviews are key.

For young architects in Singapore, remember that linkways are not just aesthetic or tokenistic elements — they are part of the public realm and must be robust, buildable, and climate-resilient.
