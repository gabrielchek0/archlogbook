### Here’s some advice on how to use this wiki:

<details>

<summary>1) Read in totality</summary>

My advice is to read all of the pages to get a better understanding and to establish what you need to work on. Do not miss any pages as there could be valuable information that you might need to have a easier transition.

**If you are a fresh architectural graduate**, you should read in order.

**If you are experienced**, you can zoom in on a certain topic in any order.

</details>

<details>

<summary>2) Read it with an open mind</summary>

This wiki represents my learnings and thoughts that may not apply to your situation. So read this with an open mind.

Try to adapt the methods towards your skillset and context.

Some firms operate on a different business model and/or structure so feel free to take the lessons that are useful and ignore those that don’t apply.

</details>

<details>

<summary>3) Do not read all at one go</summary>

This may contradict the earlier point on reading this book in totality. However, it is unwise to read this book all at one go - simply because more often than not, you will not need be able to retain all of the concepts.

Instead, read this book over a few weeks and before starting work in an architectural practice to accelerate your transition into your role as an architectural designer.
