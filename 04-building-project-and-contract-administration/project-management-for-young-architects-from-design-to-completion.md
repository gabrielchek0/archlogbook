# Project Management for Young Architects: From Design to Completion

Being a great architect isn't just about producing beautiful drawings. One of the most important (and often overlooked) parts of your career is **project management** — keeping a project on track from concept to completion.

As a young architect, you play a vital role in guiding the project team, coordinating between consultants and contractors, and ensuring your design vision is realised **on time**, **on budget**, and **to specification**. This guide will walk you through what to expect at each project stage, and how to contribute meaningfully.

***

## 1. Design Stage: From Vision to Approvals

#### Your Key Roles:

* Develop coordinated design drawings in tandem with engineers and consultants
* Prepare for and attend various **project meetings and presentations**
* Submit design for **authority clearances** (e.g., Design Gateway, Construction Gateway, Completion Gateway)

#### Types of Meetings to Attend:

* **Client-Consultant Meetings (CCMs)**: Align on design direction, functional requirements, budget.
* **Design Reviews**: Present architectural proposals to internal team, client, and stakeholders.
* **Technical Coordination Meetings (TCMs)**: Resolve clashes between architectural, structural, and M\&E elements with consultants and/or contractors.

#### Milestones to Track:

* **Design Freeze/Sign-Off** by client
* **Authority Submissions**&#x20;
* **In-Principle Approvals (IPA)**
* **Tender Documentation Finalisation** – coordinated drawings, specifications, and BOQ

> **Tip:** Design sign-offs must be documented. Avoid major changes after tender call to minimise costly variations later.

### 2. Tender Stage: Pricing and Contract Award

#### Your Key Roles:

* Coordinate tender documentation with QS and consultants
* Answer tender queries from contractors
* Evaluate technical submissions (with QS on pricing)

#### Important Documents:

* **Architectural Drawings** – properly coordinated with consultants
* **Specifications** – clear descriptions of materials, finishes, and standards
* **Addenda** – issued to all tenderers if clarifications are made during tender period

#### Milestone:

* **Tender Award & LOA Issuance** – Project enters the construction phase

### 3. Construction Stage: Managing Progress On Site

Now the real action begins. As a young architect, you'll likely take on a **Contract Administrator** or **Project Architect** role.

#### Key Responsibilities:

* Attend **monthly site meetings** with contractor and consultants
* Monitor construction progress and milestone tracking
* Respond to **Requests for Information (RFI)** and **Requests for Approval (RFA)**
* Review **shop drawings** and **material submissions**
* Track **Variation Orders (VOs)** and assess impact
* Review **Extension of Time (EOT)** claims (often raised monthly)

#### Key Project Management Concepts:

**S-Curve (Progress Tracking)**

* Graphical representation of cumulative progress vs time
* Tracks **early start**, **planned progress**, and **late finish**
* Used in monthly meetings to evaluate delays or acceleration

**RC Cycle (Reinforced Concrete Cycle)**

* Describes time taken for each structural floor slab to be cast
* Important for high-rise projects to assess construction efficiency
* RC cycle affects scheduling for architectural and M\&E trades

**Tracking Logs to Maintain:**

* **RFI/RFA Logs** – Ensure timely responses to avoid site delays
* **VO Logs** – Keep tabs on design changes and cost implications
* **Shop Drawing Logs** – Prevent rework due to outdated drawings
* **EOT Logs** – Document reasons, assessments, and approvals of delay claims

***

### 4. Construction Milestones to Watch

#### Coordinated Services Drawings (CSDs)

Must be approved and resolved before major construction phases:

* **Underground Services** – Drain lines, manholes, incoming water/electrical mains
* **1st Storey High Level Services** – Soffit M\&E services to coordinate with beam layout
* **Typical Floor Services** – Ensure no clash between ducts, conduits, and slabs
* **Roof Services** – Water tanks, lightning protection, mechanical exhausts

#### Physical Construction Milestones:

* **Topping Out / Structural Completion** – End of major concrete works
* **Service Turn-On** – Incoming power and water supply activated
* **Dry Runs for TOP** – Internal checks before inviting BCA, SCDF, PUB for inspections
* **External Works** – Carparks, drain channels, landscape must be completed before TOP
* **Application for Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP)** – Key handover milestone

> **Why These Matter:** Missing or delaying these milestones means:
>
> * Delay in TOP and key handover
> * Penalties under contract (e.g. Liquidated Damages)
> * Frustrated clients and end-users

***

### 5. Completion and Close-Out

#### Final Roles:

* Conduct defect inspections with client and contractor
* Issue **Architect’s Completion Certificate**
* Track and coordinate **Defects Rectification**
* Assist QS with **Final Account** sign-off

***

### Final Advice for Young Architects

* **Take Ownership**: You may not be the most senior in the room, but your diligence sets the tone for the team.
* **Know Your Drawings and Site Conditions**: Don’t just rely on the contractor. Visit the site often.
* **Document Everything**: Meeting minutes, RFIs, approvals — your best defence against disputes.
* **Understand the Milestones**: These aren't just administrative dates. They're contractual obligations.

***

### Conclusion

Project management is a crucial skillset for any architect — not just for ensuring the design is built correctly, but also for navigating the legal, contractual, and logistical realities of construction.

Learning to manage meetings, track milestones, and coordinate effectively with your team puts you on the path from being a good architect to becoming a reliable project leader.
