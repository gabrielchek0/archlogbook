# Common Mistakes Architects Make During Construction Stage (And How to Avoid Them)

For young architects involved in project delivery, construction stage is often where everything becomes real — drawings are interpreted, built, and evaluated. Mistakes at this stage can result in costly rectifications or time-consuming delays.&#x20;

Here’s a breakdown of common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

***

## 1. **Blind Approval of Submittals**

**What’s the mistake?**\
Approving shop drawings, material samples, and method statements without cross-checking against tender drawings, specifications, or coordination with other trades.

**Impact:**

* **Cost:** Wrong materials or systems installed that do not meet the design intent.
* **Time:** Rework and site instructions needed to rectify, delaying progress.

**How to prevent it:**

* Develop a **submittal review checklist**: check alignment with tender drawings, specifications, and coordination with other trades.
* Loop in relevant consultants during reviews (e.g. M\&E for coordinated drawings).
* Always mark up submittals with “Approved with Comments” or "No Exceptions Taken" with disclaimers to protect yourself. The onus is on contractor to comply to tender drawings and specifications regardless.
* When in doubt, do not approve and seek your QP's view on the submittal.

## 2. **Not Reviewing Combined Services Layouts**

**What’s the mistake?**\
Skipping thorough reviews of Integrated Concurrent Engineering (ICE) sessions, Combined Services Drawings (CSD) review, which integrate architectural, structural and M\&E services.

**Impact:**

* **Cost:** Clash between structure, ceiling heights, and services like ducts or sprinklers may require site rework.
* **Time:** Delay in completion due to late clash discovery and need for rework.

**How to prevent it:**

* Conduct **combined services coordination meetings** with consultants and contractor before installation.
* Mark underground structural footing locations, critical service zones and service corridors early in design.
* Use BIM or clash detection software when available, like Navisworks.

## 3. **Not Reviewing Construction Drawings Post-Tender**

**What’s the mistake?**\
Assuming the tender drawings are complete and skipping detailed design development during the construction stage.

**Impact:**

* **Cost:** Missing details lead to contractor assumptions or disputes.
* **Time:** Late RFIs, site queries, or mock-up rejections.

**How to prevent it:**

* Do a **post-award drawing audit**: identify gaps and ambiguous detailing.
* Update and issue **construction issue drawings** in a timely and coordinated manner.
* Hold internal QA reviews before releasing drawings.

## 4. **Starting Work Without Necessary Approvals**

**What’s the mistake?**\
Proceeding with works (e.g., structural elements or site clearance) before receiving approval from authorities or QP endorsements.

**Impact:**

* **Cost:** Possible stop-work orders and penalties.
* **Time:** Project halts until retrospective submissions are cleared.

**How to prevent it:**

* Maintain a **construction start checklist** tied to approval statuses.
* Coordinate with the C\&S, M\&E, and other QPs for endorsements before issuing approval to proceed.
* Include authority approval milestones in the construction program. Monthly progress meetings should include tracking for authority clearances.

## 5. **Amendment Plans Not Submitted**

**What’s the mistake?**\
Failing to submit updated plans to authorities after design changes or value engineering decisions.

**Impact:**

* **Cost:** Non-compliance can result in rejected TOP/CSC submissions. Rework might be required to tally approved plans.
* **Time:** Back-and-forth with authorities during TOP period delays occupation.

**How to prevent it:**

* Track **all design changes** via an amendment log.
* Schedule regular reviews to determine if submission of amendment plans is required.
* Communicate clearly with your submission consultant to align timelines.

## 6. **Not Visiting the Site Regularly**

**What’s the mistake?**\
Relying too much on drawings and reports without physically inspecting progress, workmanship, or site challenges.

**Impact:**

* **Cost:** Missed quality issues or incorrect installations become permanent.
* **Time:** Late identification means more work to undo and redo.

**How to prevent it:**

* Set a **routine for site inspections** — even once a week can make a difference.
* Attend key milestone checks: e.g., rebar inspection, waterproofing works, service mock-ups.
* Document site walks with photo reports and issue timely architect's instructions (AIs) when needed.

## Final Takeaway:

A successful construction phase depends on _proactive involvement_, _structured checks_, and _coordination_. Young architects must go beyond design and become accountable for delivery — because at this stage, _errors cost money and time_.

**Build good habits now**: Review carefully, ask questions, walk the site often. That’s how you’ll grow from a drawing architect into a trusted project leader.
