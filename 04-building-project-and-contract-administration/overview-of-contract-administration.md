# Overview of Contract Administration

Contract administration is the structured process of managing the rights, duties, and obligations under a building contract.&#x20;

For young architects, understanding this is critical — not only for proper project execution but also for protecting yourself and your client throughout the construction process.

## 1. Types of Building Contracts

There are various types of contracts used in the Singapore construction industry, depending on the project scale, delivery method, and party relationships. Here’s a breakdown:

### By Mechanism

* **Measurement Contracts**\
  Payment is based on actual quantities of work done, typically measured from drawings and site progress. Suitable when the scope is not fully defined.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x43;ontractor prices per item or work unit (e.g., per m² of tiling). Final contract value depends on actual work._
* **Lump Sum / Fixed Price Contracts**\
  A single contract price is agreed upon for the entire project. Variations can still occur, but the base price remains unchanged unless adjusted.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x43;ommon for traditional SIA contracts or Design & Build._
* **Design & Build (D\&B)**\
  A single entity (contractor) is responsible for both design and construction. Employer sets out **Employers’ Requirements (ERs)** and **Employers’ Notional Design**, which contractors use as a basis to bid a **lump sum price**.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x46;aster delivery but less design control for the architect unless engaged directly._

### By Standard Form

* **SIA Building Contract (Singapore Institute of Architects)**\
  Commonly used for private-sector projects. Architect is the contract administrator and impartial certifier.
* **PSSCOC (Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract)**\
  Standard for government projects (HDB, LTA, BCA, etc.). Typically used with measurement contracts and more procedural requirements.
* **REDAS Design & Build Contract**\
  Used by private developers for design-and-build developments. Prioritises speed and single responsibility through the contractor.
* **Subcontract Agreements**\
  Used between main contractor and subcontractors (e.g., M\&E trades). Architects typically do not administer these.
* **Minor Works Contract**\
  For projects with smaller scopes (e.g., under $1M). Simpler terms and processes, fewer formalities.

## 2. Key Contract Mechanisms (Chronological Order)

Here are the main mechanisms and milestones that occur in a typical project timeline. The list is not exhaustive.

1. **Commencement of Works**\
   Contract signed, site handed over, and Notice of Commencement issued.
2. **Submittals and Approvals**\
   Contractor submits shop drawings, material samples, and method statements for approval by consultants.
3. **Progress Claims and Payment Certificates**\
   Contractor submits monthly claims. Architect or QS assesses and certifies payments via interim certificates.
4. **Variations (VOs)**\
   Any change to the contract scope or specifications. Can add or omit works and affect cost/time.
5. **Extensions of Time (EOT)**\
   If delays are not the contractor’s fault (e.g., weather, late approvals), they can apply for more time. Usually within 14 days of the event (check contract clause).
6. **Retention Sum**\
   A portion (commonly 5-10%) of each payment is withheld to ensure the contractor completes outstanding works and fixes defects. Half is released upon Practical Completion, the rest after the Defects Liability Period.
7. **Delays and Liquidated Damages (LDs)**\
   If the contractor delays the project without approved EOT, LDs are imposed as pre-agreed damages (e.g., $5,000/day).
8. **Disputes**\
   Arise from payment issues, rejected variations, or EOT claims. Resolved through mediation, adjudication (SOPA), arbitration or litigation depending on contract.
9. **Practical Completion**\
   Architect certifies the project is substantially complete and usable. Triggers start of the Defects Liability Period (usually 12 months).
10. **Defects Rectification**\
    Contractor fixes any defects noted before and during the DLP. Owner can use retention money if the contractor fails to rectify.
11. **Final Account and Completion Certificate**\
    Final cost of project tallied. No further claims allowed once this is signed off.

## 3. Appointment of Architect: Employer vs Contractor

The architect’s role and duties differ based on who appoints them:

* **Traditional Contract (e.g. SIA)**\
  The **Employer** appoints the architect directly. The architect acts as designer, lead consultant, and impartial contract administrator.\
  You certify payments, assess variations, grant EOTs, and issue practical completion.
* **Design & Build Contract (e.g. REDAS D\&B)**\
  The **Contractor** appoints the architect, usually as a **Consultant Architect** to help fulfil the Employers’ Requirements.\
  The architect has no impartial role and acts more as a technical designer. The Employer may separately engage an independent **Employer’s Representative** to oversee compliance.

## 5. Things to Note for Architects Administering Contracts

Whether you’re certifying claims, assessing delays or evaluating defects, here are some must-know practices:

* **Timelines and Notices**\
  For example, under SIA, EOT claims must be submitted within **14 days** of delay events. Late notices = no entitlement.
* **Proper Documentation**\
  All variations, approvals, and instructions should be in writing. Meeting minutes, site memos and photographs are your best defence in disputes.
* **Impartiality**\
  Even if appointed by the Employer, the architect must act fairly under the contract. Biased decisions can be challenged legally.
* **Dispute Resolution Path**
  * **SIA Contract**: Arbitration
  * **PSSCOC**: Adjudication (via SOPA)
  * **REDAS**: Mediation > Arbitration
* **Common Pitfalls**
  * Delayed VOs or EOT assessments
  * Certifying payments without site verification
  * Issuing instructions without cost/time implications considered

***

## Conclusion

Understanding contract administration helps architects safeguard project quality, timelines, and relationships. Whether under a traditional SIA contract or a Design & Build delivery model, your ability to interpret and apply contract terms fairly is essential to your credibility and success.
