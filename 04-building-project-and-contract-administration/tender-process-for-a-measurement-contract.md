# Tender Process for a Measurement Contract

Measurement contracts remain widely used in both public and private sector construction projects in Singapore, particularly when the design is sufficiently developed to allow for accurate pricing based on **quantities of work**. Unlike lump sum or design-and-build contracts, measurement contracts require detailed documentation and careful preparation.

This article outlines the **key stages of the measurement contract tender process**, from early cost planning to tender award.

***

### 1. Preliminary Cost Estimates

Before preparing the tender documents, the architect or quantity surveyor (QS) will prepare **preliminary cost estimates** based on early design proposals. This is often called the **Cost Plan** or **Pre-Tender Estimate**. The purpose is to ensure that the proposed design aligns with the project budget and to inform decision-making before going to tender.

> **Note:** In government projects under PSSCOC, this is required for internal approvals and tender board submission.

***

### 2. Tender Drawing Preparations

Once the design is sufficiently developed, the **tender drawings** are prepared. These include:

* Architectural layout and detail drawings
* Structural drawings
* M\&E drawings

Drawings must be coordinated and sufficiently detailed to allow **accurate quantity take-off** and to avoid discrepancies between trades.

***

### 3. Establishing Prime Cost and Provisional Sums

Certain elements in the project may not be fully defined at the time of tender. In such cases, the QS includes:

* **Prime Cost (PC) Sums** – For supply items (e.g., tiles, sanitary fittings) where the final selection is pending.
* **Provisional Sums** – For works not fully scoped (e.g., external works, contingency), to be adjusted later based on actual cost.

These allow flexibility during contract administration while maintaining price comparability during tender evaluation.

***

### 4. Specification Preparation

A critical component of any tender package is the **Specifications**, which describe the materials, workmanship, and performance standards required.

These typically include:

* **Architectural Specifications** (e.g., floor finishes, door hardware)
* **Performance or Prescriptive Specifications** depending on the approach
* References to Singapore Standards (SS), BCA requirements, or proprietary systems
* Workmanship clauses and compliance with Green Mark/Buildability Score

> **Tip for Architects:** Use **standard specifications frameworks** (e.g. SIA Archspec) to ensure completeness and consistency.

***

### 5. Preparation of Tender Documents

All components are compiled into the full tender document, which generally includes:

* Instructions to Tenderers
* Form of Tender
* Conditions of Contract (e.g., SIA or PSSCOC)
* Preliminaries
* Bill of Quantities (BOQ)
* Drawings and Specifications

This full package forms the basis on which contractors will submit their prices.

***

### 6. Invitation to Tender (ITT)

An **Invitation to Tender (ITT)** is issued to selected pre-qualified contractors, often drawn from an **approved panel** or following a **prequalification exercise**. For public projects, this is published via **GeBIZ** or similar platforms.

The ITT specifies:

* Closing date and time
* Submission format (hardcopy/online)
* Tender briefing or site showround date (if any)

***

### 7. Form of Tender

This is the legal form the contractor signs to acknowledge:

* Their offer is valid for a specific duration (e.g. 90 days)
* They agree to the conditions and scope
* Their total tendered price (sum of BOQ + PC/Provisional Sums)

This form must be signed and submitted as part of the tender submission.

***

### 8. Tender Call

The **tender is officially opened** for submissions, often lasting 3 to 6 weeks depending on the scale and complexity of the project. During this period:

* Tender queries may be submitted by contractors
* Clarifications are issued via **Addenda** (which form part of the contract)
* No major changes should be made unless all parties are notified equally

***

### 9. Tender Close

At the stated deadline, the tender is **closed** and submissions are collected. In public tenders, the opening is often done in the presence of witnesses to ensure transparency.

All received submissions are recorded, including:

* Tenderer names
* Price
* Variations or alternative offers

***

### 10. Tender Interview / Clarifications

For shortlisted tenderers, the QS and consultants may conduct **tender interviews** to:

* Clarify abnormal rates or lump sum items
* Assess technical approach and resourcing
* Confirm understanding of scope and timelines

This is especially useful for complex projects with high provisional items or multiple interfaces.

***

### 11. Tender Evaluation

The evaluation considers more than just the lowest price. It typically includes:

* **Price comparison** – BOQ and unit rates
* **Compliance check** – Submission completeness, specifications, programme
* **Past performance** – Safety record, financial standing, track record
* **Buildability and methodology**

For government projects, a **Quality Fee Method (QFM)** or **two-envelope system** may be used to assess technical and price proposals separately.

***

### 12. Tender Recommendation & Award

After evaluation:

* A **Tender Evaluation Report** is prepared by the QS and architect
* A recommendation is made to the Employer or Approving Authority
* Upon approval, a **Letter of Acceptance (LOA)** is issued to the selected contractor

The contract sum is fixed based on the successful tender and the contractor proceeds to mobilise on site.

***

### Additional Considerations

* **Prequalification (Optional)**: For larger or specialised works, prequalification ensures only capable contractors are invited.
* **Site Showround / Briefing**: Allows contractors to familiarise with the site conditions.
* **Addenda / Clarifications**: Any changes or clarifications to the tender are formalised and issued equally to all bidders.

***

### Conclusion

Understanding the full tender process for a measurement contract helps architects deliver well-scoped, competitive, and fair construction tenders. The more complete and coordinated the tender package, the fewer the variations and disputes down the line. Architects working closely with the QS and consultants at every stage can ensure a smoother project start and stronger control throughout the construction phase.
