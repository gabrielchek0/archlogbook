## **Collaborative Contracting**

To encourage greater collaboration and mutual trust between stakeholders in the built environment sector, we have developed a set of collaborative clauses, as an Option Module to the PSSCOC, together with industry associations and government agencies. The collaborative contract provisions are currently being piloted in selected public sector projects.

**Benefits of collaborative contracting**

* Aims to reduce project cost, variations and to completion time
* Encourages teamwork/cooperation among stakeholders
* Early risk identification and joint problem solving
* Stimulates information sharing, communication and innovation
* Avoids disputes and encourages early dispute resolution
