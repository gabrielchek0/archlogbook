The Limitation Act is a law that sets a time limit on the period during which legal action can be taken in relation to building contracts. The purpose of the Limitation Act is to ensure that disputes arising from building contracts are resolved in a timely manner, and to prevent parties from indefinitely delaying legal action.

In building contracts, the Limitation Act sets a time limit of **6 years** for bringing ***legal action for breach of contract***, and a time limit of **15 years** for bringing ***legal action for defects in the construction of a building***. 

These time limits begin from the **date of completion** of the building works or from the **date of knowledge of the defect**, whichever is later.

However, there are certain exceptions in which the limitation period may be extended. For example, in cases where the defect is not immediately apparent and is discovered later, the limitation period may begin from the date of discovery. Additionally, the limitation period may be suspended in cases where the parties are engaged in negotiations or where a court has ordered a stay of proceedings.

It's important to note that the Limitation Act can vary depending on the jurisdiction, and it's always good to check the specific law of your location.
