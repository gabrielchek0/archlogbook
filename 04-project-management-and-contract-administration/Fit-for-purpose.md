## What is fit-for-purpose in Building Contracts?

In building contracts, the term "fit-for-purpose" refers to the requirement that the work or materials provided under the contract **must be suitable for the intended use.** 

This means that the work or materials must be of a quality that is appropriate for the purpose for which they are intended and must meet any relevant standards or specifications.

For example, if a building contract includes provisions for the construction of a foundation for a multi-story building, the foundation must be fit-for-purpose, meaning that it must be strong and stable enough to support the weight of the building. If the foundation is not fit-for-purpose, it may not be able to fulfill its intended function and could potentially cause problems or hazards for the building and its occupants.

The fit-for-purpose requirement is an important provision in building contracts because it helps to ensure that the work and materials provided under the contract are of a sufficient quality to meet the needs of the project. It also helps to **protect the owner by ensuring that they receive value for money and that the building is fit for its intended use.**
